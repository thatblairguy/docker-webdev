# local-web
Simple project to have [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/) run in a container locally. (Saves all the fuss of installing and updating.)

To use:
  1. Clone this repository
  2. Place the files to be served in the project's `public_html` directory (files will be ignored by git).
  3. `docker-compose up`
  4. ???
  5. Profit
